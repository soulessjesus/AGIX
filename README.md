# AGIX
AGI Chatbot  This is an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) chatbot that can perform various tasks such as keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, web search, search result refinement, and text summarization. The chatbot is built using Python and various libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers, tkinter, and asyncio.

Functionality

The AGI chatbot can perform the following tasks:

    Keyword extraction: Extract relevant keywords from a user's input.
    Sentiment analysis: Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a given text input.
    Web search: Perform a search based on a user's input.
    Search result refinement: Refine search results to make them more useful to the user.
    Text summarization: Summarize search results to provide a quick overview of the content.

Usage

To use the AGI chatbot, simply run the main.py file and interact with the GUI provided. The GUI has various input fields such as a text input for the user's query and buttons to perform specific tasks such as keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, web search, search result refinement, and text summarization.
Future Development

In the future, we plan to add more functionality to the AGI chatbot such as:

    Natural language processing (NLP): Improve the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to natural language input.
    Personalization: Allow users to customize the chatbot's responses based on their preferences.
    Machine learning: Train the chatbot to improve its accuracy and performance over time.

Dependencies

The AGI chatbot requires the following dependencies:

    Python 3.7 or later
    Hugging Face Transformers
    tkinter
    asyncio
